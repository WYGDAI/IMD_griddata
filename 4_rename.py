This code will help in organizing the folder which contains the data that are required for further analyses
    - a variety of datasets with varying names will be renamed to a standardized form as:
                            "2016-rain-IMD" or "1981-temp_min-IMD"

* The variables that need to be adjusted are given from lines *
